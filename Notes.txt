We can compile flies in python by using command
"python -m compileall myscript.py"
or "python -m py_compile myscript.py"
where myscript is the file name in first if we not mention the file name then it will compile the whole directory
and after compileing files(like .class files) are stored in the _pycache_ folder and extion is .pyc
A .pyc file is created inside the __pycache__ directory (e.g., __pycache__/myscript.cpython-38.pyc)
